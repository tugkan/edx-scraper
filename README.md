### edx Scraper Input example
```json
{
  "language": "Spanish",
  "maxItems": 7,
  "proxyConfig": {
    "useApifyProxy": true,
    "apifyProxyGroups": [
      "SHADER"
    ]
  }
}


```

## edx Course Output
The structure of each item in edx courses looks like this:
```json
{
  "courseTitle": "Comunicarnos sin daño para la reconciliación y la salud mental",
  "subject": "Medicine",
  "code": "course-v1:JaverianaX+CRSx+1T2020",
  "url": "https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:JaverianaX+CRSx+1T2020/course/."
}
```

### Extend output function

You can use this function to update the default output of this actor. This function gets a JQuery handle `$` as an argument so you can choose what data from the page you want to scrape. The output from this will function will get merged with the default output.

The return value of this function has to be an object!

You can return fields to achive 3 different things:
- Add a new field - Return object with a field that is not in the default output
- Change a field - Return an existing field with a new value
- Remove a field - Return an existing field with a value `undefined`


### Compute Unit Consumption
The actor optimized to run blazing fast and scrape many product as possible. Therefore, it forefronts all product detail requests. If actor doesn't block very often it'll scrape XXX products in XXX minutes with XXX compute units.

## During the Run

During the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what is going on. Each message always contains a short label specifying which page from the provided list is currently specified.
When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count and total item count for each page.

If you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.

## edx Export

During the run, the actor stores results into a dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.

You can manage the results in any languague (Python, PHP, Node JS/NPM). See the FAQ or <a href="https://www.apify.com/docs/api" target="blank">our API reference</a> to learn more about getting results from this edx actor.
